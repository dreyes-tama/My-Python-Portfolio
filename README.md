# My-Python-Portfolio
This is a collection of 5 projects I am most proud of this year. It is an accumulation of hard work and dedication to AP CSP.

*PROJECT 1*: (pokemon_simulator.py)
Summary: In this assignment students were tasked to create a simple game about pokemon evolution where players will choose activities to help them level up their pokemon.

  - Keeps track of the score (displays the wins/losses/ties)
  - Compares the player's choice and the computer's choice to decide the winner based on following the rules of the game.
  - Prints the results of the game, announcing the winner (or tie) of each round

*PROJECT 3*: (simple_calculator.py)
Summary: In this assignment students were tasked to create a simple calculator rpogram that allows the user to perform basic mathematical operations
***Key Features***:
  - Program defines five functions, one for each mathematical operation, that takes two parameters (two numbers player inputs) and return the result of the operation
  - Program continues to display the menu of options and allows the user to perform multiple calculations until the user chooses to quit the program.

*PROJECT 4*: (Mad-lib.py)
Summary: In this assignment students were tasked to create a fun and interactive game that allows users to input words and generate a nonsensical story.
***Key Features***:
  - Created appropriate variable names 
  - Asks the user to enter words for the blanks in the story. You can use the input() function to get user input
  - Creates a story with the user's input using string concatenation
  - Prints the completed story to the console using the print() function

*PROJECT 5*: (Secure_login_system.py)
Summary: In this assignment students were tasked with creating a program that implements a secure login system. Users should be able to enter their username and password, and the system will verify the credentials. The username comparison should be case-insensitive, while the password must match exactly.
***Key Features***:
  - Has appropriate variable names
  - Gets user input for username and password
  - Converts the entered username to lowercase or uppercase by using a method for case-insensitive comparison
